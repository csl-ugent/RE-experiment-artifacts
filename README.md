# Student Reverse Engineering Experiment Artifacts (SHP 2021–2024)

This repository contains **experiment artifacts** used in our empirical reverse engineering experiments embedded in the *Software Hacking and Protection (SHP)* course (Ghent University), run across four course editions (2021–2024).  
These artifacts support reproducibility of our reported challenge designs and treatments (e.g., obfuscation/protection configurations) while **explicitly excluding any participant data**.  

> Scope note: This repo is intentionally limited to challenge artifacts (binaries, assignments, documentation, source code, and build/obfuscation scripts). It does **not** include collected logs, student submissions, questionnaires responses, annotations, or any derived analysis datasets.

## Contents

For each year/round we provide (as available):
- **Challenge binaries** (typically stripped, unless noted)
- **Assignment text** (TXT/Markdown/PDF)
- **Supporting documentation** given to participants (e.g., architecture notes, hints, “focus” instructions)
- **Source code** (unobfuscated baseline where possible)
  

## What is NOT included

We do **not** include:
- Any student/participant data (logs, reports, solutions, survey responses)
- Any RevEngE/reAnalyst datasets or intermediate analysis products
- Any grading data or identity-linked information
